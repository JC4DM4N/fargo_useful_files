Analysis, plotting and setup files for use with data output files from FARGO3D

FARGO3D is a grid-based hydrodynamics code:
http://fargo.in2p3.fr

It is being used here mostly to track planetary migration in a protoplanetary disc.

A suite of disc setups can be generated using LHS_param_setup.py, which uses latin hypercube sampling to sample disc and planets properties from the desired parameter space. Example setups are shown in fresh_batch directory.
